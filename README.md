# Image-Toonification
This Image-Toonification was done using GANS - A generative model that is able to generate new content. 
I used 99 cartooon styles to generate different cartoon structures. 
I have the original picture and the different cartoon structures in the output of the code. 
Please check the google colab attached in my repository.
